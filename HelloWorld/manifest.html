      <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
      </p>

  <section id="atbash">
      <h2>Atbash Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Atbash Cipher is a substitution cipher that reverses the alphabet so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y', and so forth.
      </p>

  <section id="rail-fence">
      <h2>Rail Fence Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that writes the plaintext across several "rails" or lines, and then reads off the ciphertext by row. For example, with two rails, you would write every other letter on one line and the remaining letters on the other line, then read off in a zigzag pattern.
      </p>

  <section id="vigenere">
      <h2>Vigenère Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters multiple times in the encryption process. Each letter in the keyword determines the amount of shift to apply to the corresponding letter in the plaintext. It's more secure than a Caesar Cipher because the shifting varies based on the keyword.
