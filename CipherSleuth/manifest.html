      <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

      <h2>Atbash Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Atbash Cipher is a substitution cipher that reverses the alphabet so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y', and so forth.

  <section id="rail-fence">
      <h2>Rail Fence Cipher</h2>
      <p>
          The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that writes the plaintext across several "rails" or lines, and then reads off the ciphertext by row. For example, with two rails, you would write every other letter on one line and the remaining letters on the other line, then read off in a zigzag pattern.

  <section id="affine">
      <h2>Affine Cipher</h2>
      <p>
        The Affine cipher is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the ciphertext is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.

    <h2>Base64 Encoding</h2>
    <p>
      Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. It's commonly used to encode binary data, such as images or files, into a text format that can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols, such as email or HTTP.

    <h2>Binary Encoding</h2>
    <p>
      Binary is a numerical system composed of two digits: 0 and 1. In computing, binary is commonly used to represent data using a sequence of bits, where each bit represents a binary digit (0 or 1). Binary data can be encoded as a sequence of characters consisting of '0's and '1's.

    <h2>Hexadecimal Encoding</h2>
    <p>
      Hexadecimal, often abbreviated as hex, is a numerical system composed of sixteen symbols: 0-9 and A-F. It's commonly used in computing to represent binary data more compactly and expressively. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, making it easier to work with binary data.

    <h2>Morse Code</h2>
    <p>
      Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. It's a binary encoding, where each character is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes, separated by spaces or pauses.
